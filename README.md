# Installation

Currently using Python 3.9.7 to run the code, but no other libraries should be needed beyond the [Anaconda distribution of Python](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual).

# Project Motivation

There were some questions that I had before starting working, that were never answered. So this analysis aims to answer some of this questions I had, related to solo programming:
1. How is the income for those who work sole compared to those who are employed?
2. How many programming languages should I know to run my own business?
3. How many years of coding is needed to work solo?

# File Descriptions

There's one jupyter notebook available which I used to run the analysis regarding the questions above, with two extra questions which the results didn't broght significant insights.
The notebook contains exploratory analysis I used to find the answers to the questions, and in most part of it descriptive statistics were used. 
The datasets are available in this [link](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey).

# Results

The main results are available [here](https://medium.com/@rmassakazu/3-things-you-need-to-know-before-starting-your-own-coding-business-10817b1d7b3d).
